# Bitbucket Server Dark

Git that grows with you, *in the dark*

A dark theme for local installations of [Bitbucket Server]. Don't expect it to play nice with bitbucket.org.

Should work for both versions 5 and 6, but I make no guarantees about any other version, since I can't test it
 against them!

(Tested on Bitbucket Server v5.4.8 previously, and now on v6.6.1)
